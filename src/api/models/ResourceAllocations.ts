/**
 * ODIN Fleet API
 * API to access Odin Fleet, empowering developers to deploy gameservers all around the world in just a few lines of code.  To authenticate, users must send their email, password, and session ID to the **[`/api/auth`](/operations/getAuthToken)** endpoint. Upon successful authentication, an API token will be provided. This token should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for all subsequent requests.      Alternatively, you can copy your API key directly from our **[`console`](https://console.4players.io)** by opening any app, and then going to **Settings -> API Keys**.
